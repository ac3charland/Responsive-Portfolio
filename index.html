                Thanks for visiting my portfolio site! Here's some information about who I am: 
            </p>
            <p>
                I spent five years at the University of Wisconsin double majoring in Biology and Jazz Studies, and graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science. After I realized sometime around my last semester that neither of my majors were what I wanted to pursue as my career, I decided to try teaching myself to code. After spending a year teaching myself 
                <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank">Swift</a> 
                and loving every minute, I've decided I want to make coding my career!
            </p>
            
            <p>
                To that end, I'm participating in the University of Minnesota's full time Coding Bootcamp this fall. I'll learn
                <a href="https://bootcamp.umn.edu/coding/curriculum/" target="_blank">a bunch of cool stuff</a> including Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Java, and MERN. After that's finished, I hope to become a web developer or software engineer in the Twin Cities area. As a lifelong learner and lover of collaborative coding, I can't wait to find my first full-time coding job. If I sound like the kind of developer you'd want in your company, feel free to 
                <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a> 
                me with questions, or just hire me!
            </p>

            <p>
                Seriously, please hire me.
